- "Chad-Rpg" is an interactive role playing game, where you are the player and Artificial Intelligence is the storyteller of the game.
- You'll give your own choices to events throughout the game, and then, AI will shape the story based on your choices (and combat success).
- Possibilities are endless; player can fight with creatures, wonder around the world, or just chill and meet a great friend at the tavern.
 


## Starting Screen

- You can see the game planning screen at top.
- There is just 1 stable world type to play for now, but new starting conditions and world types will be added with time.


## Combat UI

- When enemies are ahead, choice ui will change to combat ui and player will be asked to select an action item or spell from the inventory/spells.
- Then, player will throw a d20 dice (1 to 20); and combat story will be calculated based on the damage/healing of the selected item and the dice number, and some element of surprise sometimes.
